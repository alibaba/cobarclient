cobarclient
============


`mvn install` will package everything for you, including the documentations, the libraries, etc.

A quick-start can be found at ~~<http://code.alibabatech.com/wiki/display/CobarClient/Home>~~(Since the domain "alibabatech" is discarded by alibaba internally, I have moved a copy of [中文版参考文档](http://afoo.me/references/cobarclient/zh/index.html) and [Reference Guide](http://afoo.me/references/cobarclient/en/index.html) to my personal blog.)

you can start with cobar-client by reading the documentation bundled with the distribution, the documentation is very elaborate.

GL & HF with cobar-client!
